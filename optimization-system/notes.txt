solve the problem of high demand in dense urban areas

seasonal demand
delever in 8:00 to 10:00




if we use the grep command to search for the word "demand" in the file notes.txt, we will get the following output:
each driver has a limited number of hours to work each day, so we need to make sure that we can meet the demand for our services without overworking our drivers.
lets imagine three vehicles so each deliver in the greddy nearest city so it take 8 hours and with the optimizaed the solutin it make it 7:30 hours
image we have 10 vehicles with routes like that so we can save 300/60 = 5 hours each day and imagine in a week or a month how much we can save or there is more vehicules
trad_tim - optimzed / 100  
and we draw a graph of the time saved in the y-axis and the number of vehicles in the x-axis...... or something like taht 
-we didn't talk about seasonal demand i think
_we needd to add real data of some enterprise before and after or something like that


we must include sources for our talk optimize 25% ..
